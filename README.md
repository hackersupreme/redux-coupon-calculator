## Overview

This is a single page app that provides an interface for creating cuopon csv data. It has two main parts: an input form for creating new cuopons and a list of cuopons where you can edit or remove individual cuopons.

After you create the cuopons you want, you can download the csv data and import it into Excel, Google Sheets, or use it any way you'd like.

It's built using React. It uses Redux to handle the data in the app and uses the animation library React Spring for animations. See the Documentation section for more information on how it's built.
